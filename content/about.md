Hi! My name is Jos and I'm a software developer specialized in .NET development.

I'm currently employed as a Consultant at [Quintor](https://www.quintor.nl) in the Netherlands.
In this role I help out clients by providing technical and architectural advice, code, and/or mentoring other developers.

In my free time I try to maintain some reposities on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jvandertil),
but I'd say that only the [ReflectionMagic](https://github.com/ReflectionMagic/ReflectionMagic) library is well maintained at the moment.

I also recently started working on some things for FoundationDB, but I'd consider those experimental for now. The rest can be considered archeological artifacts :).

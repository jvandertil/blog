## What are cookies?
Cookies are simple, small computer files that are transmitted from a website to your browser when you open a page.

In addition to cookies, there are other technologies we use that allow us to store and read information on your PC, tablet or mobile.
One example of this is local storage, which essentially works the same as cookies, and which we will refer to as ‘cookies’ for the sake of convenience.
